Arcade Game Project #4
===============================

Classic Arcade Game. 
It's a learning Project for Udacity FEND 2018.
The project must meet the following [requirements](https://review.udacity.com/#!/projects/2696458597/rubric).

### Rules of the Game

1. You have a Player and Enemies (Bugs). 
2. The Goal of the Player is to reach the water, without colliding into any one of the Enemies. 
3. The Player can move left, right, up and down (use the arrow keys). 
4. The Enemies move at varying speeds on the paved block portion. 
5. Once the Player collides with an Enemy, the Game is reset and the Player moves back to the start position. 
6. Once the Player reaches the water, the Game's level ups.

### Installing / Getting started

No installation is needed. You can download the project and open index.html in the root folder.
